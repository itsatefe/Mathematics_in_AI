# Boston Housing Dataset

## Overview
The Boston Housing Dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. It is often used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict the median value of homes in a given suburb based on various features.

The dataset was originally collected by the U.S. Census Service in 1978 and contains housing-related information for suburbs of Boston.
